      <h1>Perspectives</h1>
      <p class="content-layout">These 56 .mp3 audio clips are the result of 16 interviews conducted online by Kathleen Kelly and Chanda VanderHart with professionals across the field between May and October 2024. They are published and hyperlinked as part of the fifth chapter of the book <i>Accompaniment in America</i>: Contextualizing Collaborative Piano (Routledge 2025). In selecting this cohort of interviewees, the authors sought to highlight individuals with multiple areas of field expertise, including innovative, non-musical areas of practice informed by their deep musical study and achievement. It was an explicit aim to represent different regions of North America, reflecting the variety of circumstance and opportunity across the country. Colleagues at different stages of their careers are featured to highlight the changing landscape of our profession over time.  Individuals fulfilling various roles within collaborative piano as an industry, including departmental heads, concert stars, administrators, freelancers, and pedagogues, are featured in order to bring viewpoints from across this multifaceted profession.. The fact that each artist included can lay claim to most or all of these titles is testament to the multiplicity of skills required and fostered by musicians, and to collaborative pianists in particular.
