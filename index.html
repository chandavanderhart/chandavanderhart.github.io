        Welcome to the Accompaniment in America digital collection, created in connection with the book <i>Accompaniment in America: Contextualizing Collaborative Piano</i> (Routledge, 2025).
        <br><br>
        <i>Accompaniment in America</i> offers a transformative exploration of collaborative piano as both an essential art form and a multifaceted profession. Authored by Chanda VanderHart, Kathleen Kelly, and Elvia Puccinelli, it aims to deepen understanding of the historical, academic, and sociological dimensions of collaborative piano, with a particular focus on its development in North America.
        <br><br>
        This digital platform, architected and designed by Chanda VanderHart and implemented and programmed by David Wögerbauer, expands the book’s reach, enabling readers to delve deeper into its subjects. From interviews with field experts, to source material, to rare archival footage, these resources offer an unparalleled opportunity to explore the field’s rich history and ongoing evolution.
        <br><br>
        Through a blend of rigorous scholarship, rich storytelling, and multimedia digital innovation, this hybrid project brings the history of collaborative piano to life. By weaving together archival research, personal interviews, and advanced visualization tools, this project presents a multidimensional view of the field and its history, celebrating its complexity and cultural significance.
